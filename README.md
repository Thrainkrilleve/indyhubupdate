______________________________________________________________________

## Configuration (Optional)

Customize Indy Hub behavior in `local.py`:

### Basic Settings

```python
# Manual refresh cooldown (seconds between user refreshes)
INDY_HUB_MANUAL_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 3600  # Default: 1 hour

# Background sync windows (minutes)
INDY_HUB_BLUEPRINTS_BULK_WINDOW_MINUTES = 720  # Default: 12 hours
INDY_HUB_INDUSTRY_JOBS_BULK_WINDOW_MINUTES = 120  # Default: 2 hours
```

### Discord Notification Settings

```python
# Enable/disable Discord direct messages (default: True)
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_DM_ENABLED = True

# Footer text in Discord embeds (default: "Alliance Auth")
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_FOOTER_TEXT = "Your Alliance Name"

# How long Discord action links are valid in seconds (default: 72 hours)
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_ACTION_TOKEN_MAX_AGE = 72 * 60 * 60
```

### Discord Role-Based Notification Filtering (NEW!)

**Separate role configurations for Industry and Material Exchange notifications.**

```python
# Industry notifications (blueprints, jobs, copy requests)
# Only users with these roles get industry-related notifications
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1234567890123456789": {
        "name": "Industry Team",
        "enabled": True,
    },
}

# Material Exchange admin notifications (new orders to review)
# Only users with these roles get Material Exchange admin notifications
INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "9876543210987654321": {
        "name": "Material Exchange Managers",
        "enabled": True,
    },
}

# Multiple roles example (users with ANY role get notifications)
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1111111111111111111": {"name": "Industry Team", "enabled": True},
    "2222222222222222222": {"name": "Leadership", "enabled": True},
}

INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "3333333333333333333": {"name": "Mat Exchange Admins", "enabled": True},
    "4444444444444444444": {"name": "Finance Team", "enabled": True},
}

# Required for role checking to work
DISCORD_GUILD_ID = 123456789012345678  # Your Discord server ID

# Notes:
# - User-specific notifications (order status, approvals) are ALWAYS sent
# - Admin notifications (new orders to review) respect role filtering
# - If not configured or empty: ALL users receive that notification type
```

**How to get role IDs:**
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode)
2. Right-click a role in your server → Copy ID
3. Right-click your server icon → Copy ID (for DISCORD_GUILD_ID)

**See also:** [Discord Role-Based Notifications](#discord-role-based-notifications-new) section below for management commands.

**Scheduled Tasks** (auto-created):

- `indy-hub-update-all-blueprints` → Daily at 03:00 UTC
- `indy-hub-update-all-industry-jobs` → Every 2 hours

## Discord Role-Based Notifications (NEW!)

Restrict Discord notifications to specific roles following the [BlackhawkGT/auth-scripts](https://github.com/BlackhawkGT/auth-scripts) pattern.

### Overview

**Separate Discord notification roles for different notification types:**

- **Industry Notifications**: Blueprint jobs, copy requests, job completions → Use `INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES`
- **Material Exchange Admin Notifications**: New orders to review → Use `INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES`
- **User-Specific Notifications**: Order status, approvals/denials → ALWAYS sent to the user (no filtering)

### How It Works

1. **Industry Managers** configure `INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES` with their Discord role
   - Only get notifications about blueprints, jobs, and copy requests
   
2. **Material Exchange Managers** configure `INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES` with their Discord role
   - Only get notifications about new buy/sell orders to review
by notification type:
   - Industry: Jobs, blueprints, copy requests
   - Material Exchange: Admin notifications for new orders
2. When an admin notification is triggered:
   - ✅ **User has the role** → Notification is sent
   - ❌ **User lacks the role** → Notification is skipped (logged)
3. User-specific notifications (order status) are ALWAYS sent (no filtering)
4. Multiple roles use OR logic (user needs ANY configured role)
5. If not configured → ALL users with the permission
- `aa-discordbot` or `aa-discordnotify` installed
- Discord bot connected to your server
- Users have linked their Discord accounts in Alliance Auth
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` configured in `local.py`

### How It Works

1. You configure Discord roles in `local.py` (e.g., "Industry Team")
2. When a notification is triggered:
   - ✅ **User has the role** → Notification is sent
   - ❌ **User lacks the role** → Notification is skipped (logged)
3. Multiple roles use OR logic (user needs ANY configured role)
4. If not configured → ALL users receive notifications (default)

### Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

#### Step 1: Get Your Discord Role ID

In Discord:
1. Settings → Advanced → Turn on "Developer Mode"
2. Right-click your role (e.g., "Industry Team") → Copy ID
3. Right-click your server icon → Copy ID (for DISCORD_GUILD_ID)

#### Step 2: Add the Role

```bash
# Add a Discord role for notifications
python manage.py manage_discord_notification_roles add \
    --role-id 1234567890123456789 \
    --role-name "Industry Team"

# The command will generate settings for you to copy
```

#### Step 3: Update local.py

AdIndustry Notifications (blueprints, jobs, copy requests)
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1234567890123456789": {
        "name": "Industry Team",
        "enabled": True,
    },
}

# Material Exchange Admin Notifications (new orders to review)
# Separate role configuration!
INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "9876543210987654321": {
        "name": "Material Exchange Managersions
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1234567890123456789": {
        "name": "Industry Team",
        "enabled": True,
    },
}

# Required for role checking
DISCORD_GUILD_ID = 123456789012345678  # Your Discord server ID
```

#### Step 4: Update docker-compose.yml

**Important:** The Discord role checking utility (`discord_roles.py`) needs to be mounted into your container. 

Place the scripts in your auth-scripts directory (e.g., `./conf/auth-scripts/indyhubdiscordupdate/`).

Add these volume mounts to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  allianceauth:
    volumes:
      # ... your existing volumes ...
      
      # Indy Hub Discord Role-Based Notifications
      - ./conf/auth-scripts/indyhubdiscordupdate/discord_roles.py:/home/allianceauth/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/indy_hub/utils/discord_roles.py
```

**Optional:** If you want to use the management command for easier role configuration:
```yaml
      - ./conf/auth-scripts/indyhubdiscordupdate/manage_discord_notification_roles.py:/home/allianceauth/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/indy_hub/management/commands/manage_discord_notification_roles.py
```

**File locations:**
- Local: `./conf/auth-scripts/indyhubdiscordupdate/discord_roles.py`
- Local: `./conf/auth-scripts/indyhubdiscordupdate/manage_discord_notification_roles.py` (optional)
- Repository files: `indy_hub/utils/discord_roles.py` and `indy_hub/management/commands/manage_discord_notification_roles.py`

> **Note:** The volume mount injects the custom script into the Indy Hub package at runtime, extending the notification system with role-based filtering. This follows the same pattern as other auth-scripts (miningtaxes, discord_fix, etc.).

#### Step 5: Restart Services

```bash
# Docker
docker compose restart

# Systemd
systemctl restart allianceauth-worker allianceauth-beat allianceauth-gunicorn
```

### Management Commands

```bash
# List configured roles
python manage.py manage_discord_notification_roles list

# Add a new role
python manage.py manage_discord_notification_roles add \
    --role-id 1234567890123456789 \
    --role-name "Industry Team"

# Remove a role
python manage.py manage_discord_notification_roles remove \
    --role-id 1234567890123456789

# Clear all roles (notify everyone again)
python manage.py manage_discord_notification_roles clear
```

### Testing Your Setup

```bash
**For each notification type**, users with **ANY** of the configured roles will receive notifications:

```python
# Industry Team gets industry notifications
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1111111111111111111": {"name": "Industry Team", "enabled": True},
    "2222222222222222222": {"name": "Leadership", "enabled": True},
    "3333333333333333333": {"name": "Manufacturers", "enabled": True},
}

# Material Exchange Team gets Material Exchange admin notifications
INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "4444444444444444444": {"name": "Mat Exchange Admins", "enabled": True},
    "5555555555555555555": {"name": "Finance Team", "enabled": True},
}

# A user can have roles in both groups and receive both notification types!
```

### Notification Type Examples

| Notification | Type | Filtered By |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Job completed | Industry | `INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES` |
| Blueprint copy request | Industry | `INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES` |
| New buy order to review | Material Exchange Admin | `INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES` |
| Your order was approved | User-specific | **Never filtered** |
| Your order was rejected | User-specific | **Never filtered** |

### Multiple Roles (OR Logic)

Users with **ANY** of the configured roles will receive notifications:

```python
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "1111111111111111111": {"name": "Industry Team", "enabled": True},
    "2222222222222222222": {"name": "Leadership", "enabled": True},
    "3333333333333333333": {"name": "Manufacturers", "enabled": True},
}
```

### Disabling Role Filtering

To notify **everyone** with the permission again:

```python
# Option 1: Remove or comment out the settings
# INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {}
# INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {}

# Option 2: Empty dicts
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {}
INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {}

# You can disable one and keep the other!
# This disables industry filtering but keeps Material Exchange filtering:
INDY_HUB_DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {}  # All users with permission get industry notifications
INDY_HUB_MATERIAL_EXCHANGE_NOTIFICATION_ROLES = {
    "9876543210987654321": {"name": "Mat Exchange Managers", "enabled": True},
}  # Only this role gets Material Exchange admin notifications
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Users with role not getting notified | Check `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` is set correctly |
| All users still getting notified | Ensure roles are configured and services restarted |
| Role ID not working | Must be exact 18-19 digit number (no brackets, no quotes in Discord) |
| Discord bot errors | Ensure bot is running and connected to guild |
| User not receiving notifications | User must have Discord linked in Alliance Auth |

**Enable debug logging** in `local.py`:

```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {'console': {'class': 'logging.StreamHandler'}},
    'loggers': {
        'indy_hub.utils.discord_roles': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'handlers': ['console'],
        },
    },
}
```

#### Enhanced Buy/Sell Interface

The Material Exchange buy back inventory now includes powerful filtering, sorting, and categorization features:

**New Features:**
- **Real-time Search**: Filter items by name as you type
- **Category Filtering**: Dropdown to view items by market group (Minerals, Moon Materials, Planetary Materials, etc.)
- **Sortable Columns**: Click any column header to sort by:
  - Item Name (alphabetical)
  - Category (grouped by type)
  - Stock Quantity (numerical)
  - Unit Price (numerical)
- **Visual Categories**: Each item displays its market group as a color-coded badge
- **Clear Filters Button**: One-click reset to view all items
- **Item Counter**: Shows how many items match your current filters

**Example Use Cases:**
- Search for "Tritanium" to quickly find and purchase minerals
- Filter by "Moon Materials" category to see all available moon ore
- Sort by "Stock" to see which items have the most inventory
- Sort by "Unit Price" to find the cheapest or most expensive items

#### Flexible Tax Configuration

The Material Exchange configuration now supports **0% tax rates** for both buy and sell operations:

**What Changed:**
- Buy/Sell markup percentage fields now accept exactly **0%** (previously required minimum 0.01%)
- Clear help text indicates that 0% is a valid option
- Useful for:
  - Cost-neutral material exchanges
  - Internal corporation supply chains
  - Special promotional periods
  - Simplified pricing calculations

**Configuration Example:**
```python
# In Material Exchange Configuration page:
Sell Markup: 0%   # Members get exact Jita Buy price when selling to hub
Buy Markup: 0%    # Members pay exact Jita Buy price when buying from hub
```
